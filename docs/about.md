# What is this?

For now, the sole purpose of this website is to display an analysis of a very specific collection of movies.
Said collection resulted from a game me and a friend of mine play: Once upon a time I send him a letter with a movie recommendation and asked him to watch the movie, tell me what he thinks about it and send back another recommendation.
The clue is that there should be some kind of connection between the recommendation and the movie it is based on.
This can be anything (e.g. same actors, thematic connections, same production country, etc.). Part of the fun is guessing that the connection is.
