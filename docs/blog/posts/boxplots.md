# No pie for you!

This is a draft

<!-- more -->

- pie charts are not a good way to visualize continuous data such a movie run times
- the fact that they needed to be divided in rather abitrary categories of "between 90 and 120 minutes",
  "between 120 and 150 minutes", etc. should have been a big hint that this is not the
  best way to visualize this data
- box plots are much better and give the option to show the actual data points
